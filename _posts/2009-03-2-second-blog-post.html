<p>
Mar. 2nd - Today was somewhat slow. I stayed home to work on a few things from back home. I really dont like working on flash sites and need to avoid them from now on. I was also able to take time to sketch out a few of my architectural ideas. A lot of my time lately has been spent  thinking about my life and what I want out of it. I miss my friends and family more and more every day. Still working on a solution.
